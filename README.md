### 2nd Edition (current)

The source to accompany the 2nd edition is found in this, the default 
[`master` branch](https://github.com/sryza/aas).

### 1st Edition

The source to accompany the 1st edition may be found in the 
[`1st-edition` branch](https://github.com/sryza/aas/tree/1st-edition).

### Build

[Apache Maven](http://maven.apache.org/) 3.2.5+ and Java 8+ are required to build. From the root level of the project, 
run `mvn package` to compile artifacts into `target/` subdirectories beneath each chapter's directory.

### Running the Examples
- Install [Apache Spark](https://spark.apache.org) for your platform according following the instructions for the [latest release](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/)
- Build the projects according the instructions above.
- Launch the driver program using `spark-submit`
```bash
# working directory should be your Apache Spark installation root
bin/spark-submit /path/to/code/$CHAPTER/target/$CHAPTER-jar-with-dependencies-$VERSION.jar
```
- Some examples might require that URI paths to the data be updated to your own HDFS or local filesystem locations.
